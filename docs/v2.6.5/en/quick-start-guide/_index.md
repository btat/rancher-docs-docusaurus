Howdy buckaroos! Use this section of the docs to jump start your deployment and testing of Rancher 2.x! It contains instructions for a simple Rancher setup and some common use cases. We plan on adding more content to this section in the future.

We have Quick Start Guides for:

- [Deploying Rancher Server](/rancher/v2.6.5/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/deployment_index): Get started running Rancher using the method most convenient for you.

- [Deploying Workloads](/rancher/v2.6.5/en/quick-start-guide/workload/workload_index): Deploy a simple [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) and expose it, letting you access it from outside the cluster.
